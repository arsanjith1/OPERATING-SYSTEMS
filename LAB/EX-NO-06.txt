To write a shell script to find the factorial of a given number.
ALGORITHM:
1. Read n
2. Set fact=1, i-1
3. While(i<n), do the following
	i) fact=fact*i
	ii) i = i + 1
4. Repeat step 2 until i<=n is true
5. Print fact
6. Stop
PROGRAM:
echo "Enter a number"
read n
fact=1
i=1
while [ $i -le $n ]
do
((fact=fact * i))
((i=i+1))
done
echo "Factorial of a number $n is $fact"
EXECUTION PROCEDURE:
1. Create a script file.
2. Open a new file using vi ex5.sh.
3. Write your script and Type the shell script inside the editor Save and exit
