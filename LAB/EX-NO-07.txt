EX-NO-07:
			ARITHMETIC CALCULATOR
AIM:
  To write a shell script to perform arithmetic calculator using case statement.
ALGORITHM:
1. Read the two operand values a and b.
2. Display the menu as
a) Addition
b) Subtraction
c) Multiplication
d) Division
3. Print "Enter your choice".
4. Read your choice c among 1, 2, 3, 4
5. Check c using case statement.
if 1 ⇒ s= a+b
if 2 ⇒ s= a-b
if 3 ⇒ s= a*b
if 4 ⇒ s= a/b
6. Print the result s.
7. Stop.
PROGRAM:
echo "Enter the value of a"
read a
echo "Enter the value of b"
read b
echo "1. Addition"
echo "2. Subtraction"
echo "3. Multiplication"
echo "4. Division"
echo "Enter your choice:"
read c
case $c in
1) ((s=$a+$b))
   echo "Sum of $a and $b is $s" ;;
2) ((s=a-b))
   echo "Difference of $a and $b is $s" ;;
3) ((s=$a*$b))
   echo "Product of $a and $b is $s" ;;
4) ((s=$a/$b))
   echo "Division of $a by $b is $s" ;;
esac
EXECUTION PROCEDURE:
1. Create a script file.
2. Open a new file using vi ex5.sh.
3. Write your script and Type the shell script inside the editor Save and exit
4. Press Esc, then type: wq to save and quit.
5. Make the script executable
6. Run:
     chmod u+x ex5.sh
7. Execute the script:
   Run:
     ./ex1.sh
RESULT:
    Thus the above shell script for arithmetic calculator is developed using case statement and executed successfully and the output is obtained.
