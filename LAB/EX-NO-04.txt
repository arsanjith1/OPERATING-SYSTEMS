EX-NO-04:
			USING THE FILTERS
Aim
To write down the syntax and verify the filters: pr, head, tail, cut, paste, nl, sort, grep, egrep, fgrep, write and wall.
PROCEDURE:
a) pr:
This command can be used with Ipr command for neat hard copies.
Syntax:
pr [-options] <filename>
Option:
-l<number>-This changes the page size to the specified <number> of lines
-<number>-Prepares the output with <number of columns.
-n-This numbers each line of output.
-t-Turns off the heading at the top of the page.
b) head:
This head command prints the top N number of lines of the given file. 
Syntax:
head [-options] <filename>
Option:
-n num-Prints the first 'num' lines instead of first 10 lines.
-c num-Prints the first 'num' bytes from the file specified.
-q-It is used it more than one file is given. Because of this command, data from each file is not preceded by its file name.
-V-By this option, data from the specified file is always preceded by its filename.
c) tail:
The tail command, prints the last N number of lines of the given file. 
Syntax:
tail [-option] filename
d) cut:
This cut command is used to cut the columns/fields of a specified file.
Syntax:
cut [options] <filename>
Option:
-C-Cuts the specified characters. 
-d-Cuts a specific by a delimiter.
-f-Cuts the specified fields.
e) paste
This paste command is used to join files vertically (parallel merging), l.e., paste command merges the columns. 
Syntax:
paste [option] <filename>
Option:
-d-This option is used to specify the delimiter.
-s-This option merges the files in sequential manner.
This is option merges the files places and states sequentially as shown above.
f) nl:
nl command is used for numbering all non-blank lines in the specified text file and displays the same on the screen.
Syntax:
nl [-options] <filename>
Option:
-b-Used for numbering body lines.
-v num-Changes first line number of the given input
-s STRING-Adds any STRING after every logical line number.
g) sort:
This sort command sorts the contents of a given file based on ASCII values of characters.
Syntax:
sort [option] <filename>
Option:
-o-This option is functionally the same as redirecting the output to a file
-r-Sorts in reverse order
-U-Sorts a file with numerical data present inside
-nr-Sorts a file with numerical data in reverse order.
h) grep
This grep (global search for regular expression) filter searches a file for a particular pattern of characters and displays all lines that contain that pattern.
Syntax:
grep [-options] pattern <filename>
Option
-c
-i
-n
-v
-o
i) egrep:
egrep is a pattern searching command which belongs to the family of grep functions. 
Syntax:
egrep [-options] 'PATTERN' <file>
Option:
-c
-i
-n
-v
j) fgrep:
The fgrep command searches for fixed-character strings in a file or files.
Syntax:
fgrep [-options] fixed pattern <files>
Option:
-c
-i
-n
-V
k) write:
This write command is a communication command which is used to send a message to another specific user.
syntax: From the root, use the following.
write <Recipient Login Name>
<message>
press ctrl+d
l) wall (write all):
This wall (write all) command is also a communication command used by the super-user to send a message to all the users who were currently logged on the system.
From the root, use the following
Syntax:
wall
message
press [ctrl+d] at the end
RESULT:
	Thus the above general purpose commands pr, head, tail, cut, paste, nl, sort, grep, egrep, fgrep and communication commands write and wall are executed successfully.
